# Machine learning

A range of AC signals of varying frequency and amplitudes are inputted between the probes in a solution of known salinity and the output is then measured and recorded.

This is then used to find the impedance at that specific Amplitude and Frequency.

This data is then used to train a ML model with the function (Frequnecy, Amplitude, Impedance) = (salinity)
