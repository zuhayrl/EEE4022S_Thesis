Difficulties that have arisen in existing practices are discussed, in particular, the situation regarding reduction of in-situ CTD observations. The Practical Salinity Scale 1978 is an attempt to remove the shortcomings; it has been recommended for international acceptance. The basis for this new scale is an equation relating the ratio of the electrical conductivity of the seawater sample to that of a standard potassium chloride solution (KCI) at15{\textbackslash}degC atmospheric pressure. The samples used were prepared from standard seawater diluted with distilled water or evaporated by weight. Finally, the set of new equations for CTD data reduction is given, based upon the work of authors whose papers are appearing elsewhere in this volume.},

	abstract = {Salinity data used to trace water movement or compute density are normally derived from measurements of chlorinity or electrical conductivity, temperature, and pressure. The latter technique has a precision about 1 order of magnitude greater than that of a typical chlorinity titration, but both are sensitive, in different ways, to variations in the ionic ratios of seawater. Present definitions of salinity are also ion dependent, causing significant variations in the salinity-density relationship which cannot be simply expressed. In order to obtain density to an accuracy commensurate with the available precision it is best to define salinity in relation to a water mass of known ionic content so that a density correction to be applied to other water masses may be expressed as variations from a fixed standard. These corrections then appear in the form of simple additive constants for most waters, and where density difference is the important parameter, no correction is necessary within a specific water mass. The new salinity definition is based on dilution by weight of a conductivity ratio labeled standard seawater. It would be invariant under compositional variations and in accord with the proposed new equation of state (Grasshoff, 1976). It is conservative within acceptable limits, would provide a ‘practical salinity scale’ for use by oceanographers of all levels of sophistication, and would greatly facilitate data comparisons between institutions. The present variety of computational procedures for in situ data reduction would be replaced by one set of definitive equations that would not be subject to change as the precision of physical or chemical measurement improved. A great part of the data base necessary to write these equations exists, and the remainder should be available by 1978.},

	abstract = {A 27-term index of refraction algorithm for pure and sea waters has been developed using four experimental data sets of differing accuracies. They cover the range 500–700 nm in wavelength, 0–30°C in temperature, 0–40 psu in salinity, and 0–11,000 db in pressure. The index of refraction algorithm has an accuracy that varies from 0.4 ppm for pure water at atmospheric pressure to 80 ppm at high pressures, but preserves the accuracy of each original data set. This algorithm is a significant improvement over existing descriptions as it is in analytical form with a better and more carefully defined accuracy. A salinometer algorithm with the same uncertainty has been created by numerically inverting the index algorithm using the Newton-Raphson method. The 27-term index algorithm was used to generate a pseudo-data set at the sodium D wavelength (589.26 nm) from which a 6-term densitometer algorithm was constructed. The densitometer algorithm also produces salinity as an intermediate step in the salinity inversion. The densitometer residuals have a standard deviation of 0.049 kg m−3 which is not accurate enough for most oceanographic applications. However, the densitometer algorithm was used to explore the sensitivity of density from this technique to temperature and pressure uncertainties. To achieve a deep ocean densitometer of 0.001 kg m−3 accuracy would require the index of refraction to have an accuracy of 0.3 ppm, the temperature an accuracy of 0.01°C and the pressure 1 db. Our assessment of the currently available index of refraction measurements finds that only the data for fresh water at atmospheric pressure produce an algorithm satisfactory for oceanographic use (density to 0.4 ppm). The data base for the algorithm at higher pressures and various salinities requires an order of magnitude or better improvement in index measurement accuracy before the resultant density accuracy will be comparable to the currently available oceanographic algorithm.},

	abstract = {Ion chromatography (IC) presents new possibilities for assessing information about environmental samples, namely waters of various compositions, ranging from high-purity water to highly saline ones. Constant proportion between major ions present in seawater, has been assumed in the past, from which the first practical equation relating chlorinity and salinity has been developed, being later substituted by a practical salinity scale, derived from conductivity measurements relative to a standard seawater, according to internationally accepted recommended procedures. Seawaters are characterized by salinity values around 35 while derived saline solutions may present considerable changes in ionic composition, conductivity, hence on salinity. Natural and anthropogenic phenomena may introduce new issues requiring clarification for which qualitative and quantitative information from additional sources is useful, e.g. ionic composition from IC. The different ranges of concentration of major and minor species present in seawater and derived saline solutions are a challenge for the optimization of a practical methodology for composition assessment in two single IC runs, one for anions and another one for cations, which has been attained in this work. Composition of saline solutions determined by IC was critically assessed in terms of anion–cation balance and further related to conductivity and salinity measurements aiming to evaluate the quality/completeness of ion chromatographic analyses performed at preselected conditions and to search for other meaningful relations for efficient recognition/distinction between saline solutions of different types.},

This LAMP-BHU Protocol involves the preparation of simulated saline water. It has been developed after BMS measurement of 20 simulated seawater samples in different frequencies, i.e., F1 (976 Hz), F2 (3904 Hz), and F3 (15616 Hz) to prepare a standard data. This standard data is further validated with field data. Fourteen water samples are collected from the field, and hydrogeological data (salinity and conductivity) and BMS at three different frequencies were measured. Further linear regression analysis is performed on the measured data. This protocol yields efficient results with F3, followed by F1 and F2 having an R2 value of 0.84, 0.60, and 0.54, respectively, for salinity, and 0.79, 0.51, and 0.40, respectively, for conductivity. Salinity and conductivity are showing a negative trend with all the frequencies. This protocol enables to delineate saline water intruded zone or extent of saline intrusion using BMS analysis. The proposed protocol is a rapid and efficient mode of determination of the saline water intruded zones in the coastal aquifers for prioritisation of groundwater assets facilitating freshwater availability in coastal areas.},

In this regard, electrochemistry can face both objectives by studying the electrode/solution interface. As a result, different electrochemical techniques can be used to study the interface to understand the electron transfer phenomena in different reactions. Considering this, one of the most useful techniques to understand the electrode/ solution interface is electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. This technique allows us to describe the electrode behavior in the presence of a certain electrolyte in terms of electrical parameters such as resistances and capacitances, among others. With this information, we can infer the electrochemical behavior toward a specific reaction and the capacity of the electrode to carry on the electron transfer depending on its resistance (impedance) values. The aim of this chapter is to go from the theory, based on Ohm's Law and its derivations, to actual applications. This will lead us to characterize the solution, electrode, and the interface between these two phases based on their electrical components by using an equivalent electrical circuit, such as the Randles equivalent circuit.},

	abstract = {Water’s salinity plays an important role in the environment. It can be determined by measuring conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD). The corresponding sensor systems are commonly large and cumbersome. Here, a 7.5 × 3.5 mm chip, containing microstructured CTD sensor elements, has been developed. On this, 1.5 mm2 gold finger electrodes are used to measure the impedance, and thereby the conductivity of water, in the MHz frequency range. Operation at these frequencies resulted in higher sensitivities than those at sub-MHz frequencies. Up to 14 kΩ per parts per thousand salt concentration was obtained repeatedly for freshwater concentrations. This was three orders of magnitude higher than that obtained for concentrations in and above the brackish range. A platinum electrode is used to determine a set ambient temperature with an accuracy of 0.005°C. Membranes with Nichrome strain gauges responded to a pressure change of 1 bar with a change in resistance of up to 0.21 Ω. A linear fit to data over 7 bars gave a sensitivity of 0.1185 Ω/bar with an R2 of 0.9964. This indicates that the described device can be used in size-limited applications, like miniaturized submersibles, or as a bio-logger on marine animals.},

Argo arose from a compelling scientific need for climate-relevant ocean data; it was made possible by technology development and implemented through international collaboration. The float program and its data management system began with regional arrays in 1999, scaled up to global deployments by 2004, and achieved its target of 3000 active instruments in 2007. US Argo, supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Navy through the National Oceanographic Partnership Program, provides half of the floats in the international array, plus leadership in float technology, data management, data quality control, international coordination, and outreach. All Argo data are freely available without restriction, in real time and in research-quality forms. Uses of Argo data range from oceanographic research, climate research, and education, to operational applications in ocean data assimilation and seasonal-to-decadal prediction. Argo's value grows as its data accumulate and their applications are better understood. Continuing advances in profiling float and sensor technologies open many exciting possibilities for Argo's future, including expanding sampling into high latitudes and the deep ocean, improving near-surface sampling, and adding biogeochemical parameters.]},

	abstract = {The literature on estuarine physical studies is vast, diverse and contains many valuable case studies in addition to pure, process-based research. This essay is an attempt to summarize both some of the more recent studies that have been undertaken during the last several years, as well as some of the trends in research direction and progress that they represent. The topics covered include field and theoretical studies on hydrodynamics, turbulence, salt and fine sediment transport and morphology. The development and ease-of-application of numerical and analytical models and technical software has been essential for much of the progress, allowing the interpretation of large amounts of data and assisting with the understanding of complex processes. The development of instrumentation has similarly been essential for much of the progress with field studies. From a process viewpoint, much more attention is now being given to interpreting intratidal behaviour, including the effects of tidal straining and suspended fine sediment on water column stratification, stability and turbulence generation and dissipation. Remote sensing from satellites and aircraft, together with fast sampling towed instruments and high frequency radar now provide unique, frequently high resolution views of spatial variability, including currents, frontal and plume phenomena, and tidal and wave-generated turbidity. Observations of fine sediment characteristics (floc size, aggregation mechanisms, organic coatings and settling velocity) are providing better parameterizations for sediment transport models. These models have enhanced our understanding both of the estuarine turbidity maximum and its relationship to fronts and intratidal hydrodynamic and sedimentological variability, as well as that of simple morphological features such as intertidal mudflats. Although few, interdisciplinary studies to examine the relationships between biology and estuarine morphology show that bivalve activity and the surface diatom biofilm on an intertidal mudflat can be important in controlling the erosion of the surface mud layer.},

In its most general form, increases of charge transfer resistance or decrease of double layer capacitance at the interface are used for reporting EIS system changes due to pathogens. However, this strategy is not universally adaptable to various EIS sensors and could lead to inaccurate detection. Herein, we demonstrated a machine learning-based EIS biosensor for E.coli detection with improved accuracy. EIS data was obtained from gold electrodes immobilized with E.coli through antibody binding and fitted with the Randles model to extrapolate multiple impedimetric parameters. A machine learning model, using principle component analysis and support vector regression, was trained to automatically establish a quantitative relationship between multiple impedimetric parameters and bacterial concentrations. Results showed an improved accuracy in determining bacterial concentration. The improvement is due to the integration of both capacitance and resistance information. These results thus pave the way for automatic and accurate EIS biosensors in various applications.},

To train machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence models, it is crucial to have a substantial amount of high-quality data for effective data collecting. System performance data is essential for refining algorithms, enhancing the efficiency of software and hardware, evaluating user be-havior, enabling pattern identification, decision-making, predictive modeling, and problem-solving, ultimately resulting in improved effectiveness and accuracy. The integration of diverse data collecting and processing methods enhances precision and innovation in problem-solving. Utilizing diverse methodologies in interdisciplinary research streamlines the research process, fosters innovation, and enables the application of data analysis findings to pattern recognition, decision-making, predictive modeling, and problem-solving. This approach also encourages in-novation in interdisciplinary research. This technique utilizes the concept of decision trees, con-structing a collection of decision trees and aggregating their outcomes to generate the ultimate prediction. Every decision tree inside a random forest is constructed using random subsets of data, and each individual tree is trained on a portion of the whole dataset. Subsequently, the outcomes of all decision trees are amalgamated to derive the ultimate forecast. One of the bene-fits of random forests is their capacity to handle unbalanced data and variables with missing values. Additionally, it mitigates the issue of arbitrary variable selection seen by certain alterna-tive models. Furthermore, random forests mitigate the issue of overfitting by training several de-cision trees on random subsets of data, hence enhancing their ability to generalize to novel data. Random forests are highly regarded as one of the most efficient and potent techniques in the domain of machine learning.

The impedance model is usually employed to analyze battery EIS quantitatively, and parameter identification for the impedance model is of vital importance. However, the current parameter identification for the impedance model is mainly achieved through heuristic optimization and nonlinear least squares methods, which may be time consuming when used to process a large amount of EIS data at once with low convergence speed. To deal with these issues, this study proposes an innovative parameter identification method for the battery impedance model using the Neural Network approach. First, the relationship between cyclic aging and model parameter variation was investigated. To enhance the networks' adaptiveness and effectiveness, 32000 synthetic EISs were generated to assist the offline training process. Then four Neural Network models with EIS data within different frequency ranges as input were employed to identify the model parameters. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve a relative mean absolute error of 2.30\% compared with software RelaxIS, and a mean error impedance 3.64E–4 Ohm compared to experimental EIS.},

However, this process often relies on human experience and judgment, which will introduce subjectivity and error. In this paper, an intelligent approach is proposed for matching EIS data to their equivalent circuits based on the Random Forest algorithm. It can automatically select the most suitable equivalent circuit model based on the characteristics and patterns of EIS data. Addressing the typical scenario of metal corrosion, an atmospheric corrosion EIS dataset of low-carbon steel is constructed in this paper, which includes five different corrosion scenarios. This dataset was used to validate and evaluate the proposed method in this paper. The contributions of this paper can be summarized in three aspects: (1) This paper proposes a method for selecting equivalent circuit models for EIS data based on the Random Forest algorithm. (2) Using authentic EIS data collected from metal atmospheric corrosion, the paper establishes a dataset encompassing five categories of metal corrosion scenarios. (3) The superiority of the proposed method is validated through the utilization of the established authentic EIS dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that, in terms of equivalent circuit matching, this method surpasses other machine learning algorithms in both precision and robustness. Furthermore, it shows strong applicability in the analysis of EIS data.},

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results play an essential role in analyzing the interfacial properties of materials. Nonetheless, in many situations, the data is misinterpreted due to the complexity of the electrochemical system or the compromise between the experimental result and the theoretical model, resulting in partiality in the interpretation process, especially for the impedimetric results. Typically, the experimenter interprets impedimetric results using a searching approach based on a theoretical model until the best-fitting model is obtained, which is a time-consuming process, and errors can occur. To reduce misinterpretation by the experimenter, herein, the machine-learning strategy is demonstrated for the classification of an EIS circuit model and parameter prediction using a deep neural network (DNN). The DNN model shows a highly accurate classifier for the commonly used EIS circuit with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of more than 0.95. Additionally, the model demonstrates high accuracy in the prediction of EIS parameters on a complex EIS system, with a maximum R2 of 0.999. These reveal that the machine-learning strategy may open a new room for studying electrochemical systems.},

But, at present, it is unknown what sample size requirements are appropriate when using ANNs in this particular context. This paper fills this knowledge gap: we empirically establish a rule-of-thumb for ANN-based discrete choice analysis based on analyses of synthetic and real data. To investigate the effect of complexity of the data generating process on the minimum required sample size, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo analyses using a series of different model specifications with different levels of model complexity, including RUM and RRM models, with and without random taste parameters. Based on our analyses we advise to use a minimum sample size of fifty times the number of weights in the ANN; it should be noted, that the number of weights is generally much larger than the number of parameters in a discrete choice model. This rule-of-thumb is considerably more conservative than the rule-of-thumb that is most often used in the ANN community, which advises to use at least ten times the number of weights.},
