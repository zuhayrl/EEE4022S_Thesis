        \item I know that plagiarism is wrong.
        Plagiarism is to use another's work and pretend that it is one's own.
        \item I have used the IEEE convention for citation and referencing.
        Each contribution to, and quotation in, this report `The Measurement of Water Salinity in Water Towers' from the work{(s)} of other people has been attributed and has been cited and referenced.
        Any section taken from an internet source has been referenced to that source.
        \item This report `The Measurement of Water Salinity in Water Towers' is my own work and is in my own words (except where I have attributed it to others).
        \item I have not paid a third party to complete my work on my behalf.
        My use of artificial intelligence software has been limited to giving overviews of topics, aiding with {\LaTeX} commands, and aiding with making BibTeX citations of sources (specify precisely how you used AI to assist with this assignment, and then give examples of the prompts you used in your first appendix).
        \item I have not allowed and will not allow anyone to copy my work with the intention of passing it off as his or her own work.
        \item I acknowledge that copying someone else's assignment or essay, or part of it, is wrong, and declare that this is my own work

    % Place your abstract here.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Open the {\bf Project Report Template.tex} file and carefully follow the comments (starting with \%).
        \item Process the file with {\bf pdflatex}, using other processors may need you to change some features such as graphics types.
        \item Note the files included in the  {\bf Project Report Template.tex} (with the {.tex} extension excluded). You can open these files separately and modify their contents 
        or create new ones.
        \item Contact the latex namual for more features in your document such as equations, subfigures, footnotes, subscripts \& superscripts, special characters etc.
        \item I recommend using the {\bf kile} latex IDE, as it is simple to use.
