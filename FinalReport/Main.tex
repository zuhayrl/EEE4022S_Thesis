{\Huge Acknowledgments}\\
%\hrule
\vskip 10mm
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Justin Pead, for his invaluable guidance, support, and expertise throughout this research.
His insights and encouragement were instrumental in bringing this work to fruition.

I am also deeply grateful to my friends for their unwavering moral support during this journey.
Their encouragement and understanding made the challenges of this process far more manageable.

Lastly, I would like to thank my family for their support during my studies.

    {\Huge Abstract}\\
    %\hrule
    \vskip 10mm

    % Place your abstract here.
    Ice shelves form when glaciers flow from the Antarctic out over the ocean.
    This ice, which is originally freshwater ice is formed from accumulated snow, extends over the water and floats, because ice is less dense than water.
    When saltwater freezes at the bottom of the ice shelves, salt is expelled, forming a brine like solution, with a high salt density, directly under the ice shelves.

    The salinity of this brine solution and the seawater underneath need to be measured to aid in Antarctic research.
    This project documents the design and testing of a conductivity-based salinity measuring device to measure the salt content in these areas.
    The prototype was designed in two parts, a probe module, which would be lowered down through a water tower, which was drilled into the ice shelves, to measure the salinity, and a controller, which would be used to send instructions and receive data from the probe.
    The probe utilised gold electrodes to measure and analyse the salinity through conductivity.
    Two methods were investigated,~\gls{dc}, where point voltage measurements and voltage sweeps were conducted, and~\gls{ac} where a machine learning model was used to map properties of the input and output waves to a salinity value.
