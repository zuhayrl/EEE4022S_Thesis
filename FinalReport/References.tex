%Use the IEEE numbered reference style for referencing your work as shown in your thesis guidelines.
%Please remember that the majority of your referenced work should be from journal articles, technical
%reports and books not online sources such as Wikipedia.


%Discuss the referencing style with your supervisor. When you are writing your document (if you are not using a citation editor) write the surname and date of the reference in square brackets when it is needed and highlight it as follows [Smith, 2004]. You can then return back to this later, update the numbers as they appear in text and remove the highlighting.
