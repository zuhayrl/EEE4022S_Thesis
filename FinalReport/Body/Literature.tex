\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Introduction}
Accurate salinity measurement is fundamental to oceanographic research.
Traditional measurement techniques have evolved from labour-intensive chemical titration methods to modern electronic sensors, with electrical conductivity emerging as the predominant approach due to its combination of accuracy, speed, and practical deployability.
This literature review examines the current state of salinity measurement technology with particular emphasis on conductivity-based methods and emerging machine learning approaches for electrochemical data interpretation. The review is organised into three main sections.
First, we establish the fundamental concepts of salinity and provide a comprehensive comparison of available measurement techniques.
Second, we examine the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of electrical conductivity measurements for salinity determination, including instrumentation, calibration procedures, and current limitations.
Finally, we explore the application of \gls{eis} and \gls{ml} as advanced approaches for enhanced salinity analysis, examining how frequency-domain measurements and intelligent data processing can overcome limitations of traditional single-frequency conductivity methods.
This comprehensive review provides the theoretical and methodological foundation for developing a machine learning-enhanced impedance spectroscopy approach for salinity determination.

\section{Salinity: Definition}
Salinity is a fundamental characteristic of water, and is most commonly defined as the total amount of dissolved salts in water, and in the context of oceanography, seawater.
It is typically expressed in \gls{ppt} or \gls{psu}~\cite{salinity_def}. 
The concept of salinity has evoloved significantly from its early definition, which was based on chlorinity measurements.
Modern salinty is defined through the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78), where salinity is based on the conductivity ratio of standard seawater solutions, to a standard Potassium Chloride solution, and is dimensionless~\cite{unesco_salinity}.
The salinity-conductivity relationship is however, quite complex, requiring corrections and calibrations needed for depth and temperature, as these both play a factor in the conductivity of the water. 

\section{Overview of Salinity Measurement Methods}
There are a multitude of methods which can be used to measure salinity, each with their own advatages, limitations and levels of accuracy.
Traditional methods include gravimetric analysis, chemical titration (such as the Mohr-Knudsen method for chlorinity), and refractometry. While these techniques can provide accurate results, they are often time-consuming, require skilled operators, and are not easily adaptable to in-situ or automated measurements.
Modern approaches predominantly rely on electrical conductivity sensors, which offer rapid, repeatable, and automated salinity determination.
Other techniques, such as optical methods and ion-selective electrodes, have also been explored, but are less commonly used in oceanographic applications due to issues with robustness, calibration, or specificity.
The choice of method depends on the required accuracy, operational environment, and available resources.


\subsection{Historical Methods}
\subsubsection{Chlorinity Titration}
Early salinity measurements relied on chemical titration methods, in particular the Mohr-Knudsen chlorinity titration, which used silver nitrate.
The chlorinity of a solution has the definition `the mass of silver required to precipitate completely the halogens in $0.3 285 234 kg$ of the ocean-water sample'
This method was highly accurate, with results within ($\pm0.001$ PSU). However, it relied heavily on toxic chemicals, and was a time-consuming laboratory procedure, with limited practical application in the field.

\subsubsection{Gravimetric Methods}
Gravimetric analysis, a technique used to determine an amount of a substance, by measuring its change in mass, invloves evaporation and the weighing of dissovled solids.
This method directly provided measurements of the salt content, within accuracies of ($\pm0.001$ PSU), under controlled laboratory conditions.
This method remains the reference standard for calibration processes, but is however, extremely slow.

\subsection{Physical Property Based Methods}
There are several methods that utilise the relationship between salinity and the physical properties of water.

\subsubsection{Hydrometric and Density Methods}
Hydrometric methods using density measurements via hydrometers, offer salinity measurements that are low-cost, and electronics free. 
However, they are limited in precision with accuracies of $\pm 1-2$ PSU, and require large sample volumes.
The hydrometer is a floating instrument, that sinks to different depths depending on the density of the solution, and by measuring how high or low it floats, the density of the solution can be determined.
The following equation is used to map the relationship between salinity and density.

\begin{equation}
    \rho = \rho_0(1+kS)
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the density, $\rho_0$ is the density of fresh water, $S$ is the salinity and $k$ is the proportionality constant. 

This can then be inverted to give Salinity from Density:

\begin{equation}
S = \frac{\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}-1}{k}
\end{equation}

This however, does not include temperature correction.

\subsubsection{Refractometric Thechniques}
Refractometric techniques measure the refractive index changes cuased by the dissovled salts.
The refractive index of seawater is influenced by wavelength, temperature, salinity, and pressure. 
Within the range of 500-700~nm wavelength, 0-30$^\circ$C temperature, 0-40~PSU salinity, and 0-11000~dbar pressure, the refractive index equation provides an accuracy of 0.4-80~ppm~PSU, with accuracy decreasing as pressure increases.
Refractometers, which require only a small sample volume, are compact devices, making them suitable for portable field measurements.
Fibre optic refractometers have improved portability and reduced temperature sensitivity, with moderate accuracy (Â±0.5-1 PSU), making them increasingly popular in aquaculture applications. 


\subsubsection{Freezing Point Osmometry}
Freezing point depression osmometry exploits the colligative (i.e.~relating to the binding together of molecules) properties of dissolved salts.
The main principle relies on freezing point depression, which is the phenomenon where a solvents freeving point is lowered when a solute is added to it.
To perform the measurement, the water is cooled till its freezing point and the temperature drop is measured, which is then used to calculate the osmolality.
This method can achieve accuracies as high as ($\pm0.001$ PSU), however its requirement for precise temperature control limits its usage to laboratory applications.

\subsubsection{Interferometry}
Interferometry is a measurement technique which measures how electro-magnetic waves are affected by changes in a solution.
Two identical light waves are passed through two solutions, one benchmark and one test sample solution.
The gain and phase shift between the waves is then used to calculate the salinity. 
This method requires precisely aligned mirrors to direct the light waves, causing it to be relatively large.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Induction and Magnetic Permeability}

\section{Conductivity-Based Salinity Measurements}
\subsection{Theoretical Foundation}
Electrical conductivity has emerged as the predominant method for salinity measurement due to its practical implementation, high accuracy and fast response time.
The technique utilises the strong correlation between dissolved ionic content and electrical conductivity.

The conductivity of a liquid is measured by its ability to conduct electrical current.
The relationship between conductivity and salinity is based on the concentration of dissolved ions in seawater.
The main ions found in sea water ($Na^+, Cl^-, Mg^{2+}, {SO_4}^{2-}, Ca^{2+}, K^+$) maintain a relatively constant proportional relationship, in ocean waters~\cite{chemical_ocean}.
This enables robust corrections between conductivity and total dissolved salt content.
Unlike other measurement techniques, conductivity accounts for all the ions in the water, not only chlorine, which is why it is considered a more accurate measure of salinity~\cite{salinity_def_calc}.

The Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78) defines Practical Salinity $S_p$ through the conductivity ratio $K_{15}$, as shown below~\cite{teos-10}:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:k15_salinity}
    K_{15} = \frac{C(S_p, 15, 0)}{C(KCl, 15, 0)}
\end{equation}

where the numerator, $C(S, 15, 0)$ represents the conductivity of seawater sample at 15$^\circ$C and standard atmospheric pressure ($1 atm/101.325 kPa/0dbar$), and the denomimator, $C(KCl, 15, 0)$ is the conductivity of a standard $KCl$ (Potassium Chloride) solution under identical temperature and pressure.
The standard $KCl$ solution consists of $32.4356 \times 10^{-3}kg$ of $KCl$ dissolved in $1kg$ of water~\cite{lewis_pss78}.
When the ratio between the water sample and the $KCl$ solution is 1, i.e. $K_{15} = 1$, then the Practical Salinity $S_p$ is, according to the definition, 35~\cite{teos-10}.

It is important to note that Practical Salinity is a unit-less quantity, and though it may be convenient, it would be incorrect to quote it in \gls{psu}. 
Practical salinity should rather be quoted as a certain Practical Salinity `on the Practical Salinity Scale PSS-78'~\cite{teos-10}. 

When $K_{15}$ does not equal 1, Practical Salinity, $S_p$ can be calculated using the equation below~\cite{teos-10}: 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:salinity_short}
    S_p = \sum_{i=0}^{5}a_i{(K_{15})}^{i/2} 
\end{equation}

where $K_{15}$ is the equation defined above (Equation~\ref{eqn:k15_salinity}), and the coefficients $a_i$ are given in Table (\ref{tabel:pss-78}).


\subsection{Temperature and Pressure Compensation}
When calculating salinity at conditions other than 15$^\circ$C, and $0dbar$, the conductivity ratio $R$ is expanded to the product of three ratios $R_p$, $R_t$ and $r_t$ as follows~\cite{teos-10}:
\begin{equation}
    R=\frac{C(S_p, t, p)}{C(35, 15, 0)} = R_p R_t r_t
\end{equation}

where $t$, and $p$ are the temperature and pressure valid over the ranges $-2^{\circ}C \leq t \leq 35^{\circ}C$ and $0 \leq p \leq 10 000dbar$ respectively.

These ratios can be expanded as follows:

\begin{equation}
    R = \frac{C(S_p, t, p)}{C(35, 15^{\circ} C, 0)} = \frac{C(S_p, t, p)}{C(S_p, t, 0)} \cdot \frac{C(S_p, t, 0)}{C(35, t, 0)} \cdot \frac{C(35, t, 0)}{C(35, 15^{\circ} C, 0)} = R_p R_t r_t
\end{equation}

This equation represents the ratio between the conductivity measurement of a sample $C(S_p,t,p)$ and the conductivity of the standard solution $C(35, 15^{\circ}, 0)$~\cite{teos-10}. 
In order to find the salinity, $R_p$, $R_t$ and $r_t$ need to be caculated.
First, $r_t$ is calculated using the temperature of the sample:
\begin{equation}
    r_t = \sum_{i=0}^{4} {c_i}{t_i}
\end{equation}
$R_p$ is then calculated as a function of the temperature $t$, pressure $p$, and conductivity ratio $R$:
\begin{equation}
    R_p = 1 + \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{3}{e_i}{p^i}}{1+d_1{t}+d_2{t^2}+R[d_3+d_4 {t}]}
\end{equation}
Finally, $R_t$ can be evaluated using $R$, $R_p$ and $r_t$:
\begin{equation}
    R_t = \frac{R}{{R_p}{r_t}}
\end{equation} 

At standard conditions, i.e., temperature $t=15{^\circ}$C, $R_t$ is equal to $K_{15}$ an therefore Practical salinity $S_p$ can be calculated from Equation~\ref{eqn:k15_salinity}.
For cases where the temperature is not $t=15^\circ$C, Practical Salinity $S_p$ is given as a function of $R_t$, with $k=0.0162$~\cite{teos-10}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:salinity_full}
S_p = \sum_{i=0}^{5} a_i {(R_t)}^{i/2} + \frac{t-15}{1+k(t-15)} \sum_{i=0}^{5} b_i {(R_t)}^{i/2}
\end{equation}

Note that Equations~(\ref{eqn:k15_salinity}) to~(\ref{eqn:salinity_full}) are only valid in the range $2 < S_p < 42$, $-2^{\circ}C \leq t \leq 35^{\circ}C$ and $0 \leq p \leq 10 000dbar$.

It must be noted that the PSS-78 equations use the IPTS-68 temperature scale and in order for them to work with the current ITS-90 scale, must be converted using the equation below~\cite{teos-10}:
\begin{equation}
    t_{68}^{circ}C = 1.00024\times{t_{90}^{circ}C}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Instrumentation and Technology}
The most common method for measuring salinity is by using a~\gls{ctd} device.
The fundamental concept of these devices involves placing two electrodes in a sample of water, applying a voltage across them and measuring the water's response. This is then paired with a temperature and depth correction, allowing for an accurate salinity measurement.
The depth value for these calculations is taken from the pressure at which the measurement is taken.
This pressure is then traslated to depth using the standard depth to pressure equation.
Modern CTD systems achieve salinity accuracies better than $\pm0.005$ \gls{psu}, with some instruments like the Sea-Bird 911 Plus demonstrating historical accuracies of $\pm0.002$ \gls{psu} or $\pm0.0002$ \gls{psu}.

\subsection{Applications and Limitations}
Conductivity-based salinity measurements excel in most oceanographic and water quality applications due to its accuracy, speed, and reliability.
The conductivity method allows for real-time data capture, continuous monitoring, and easy integration with autonomous devices. 

However, this method does face some limitations. Due to its dependance on the water's capacity to conduct electricity, freshawater applications require specialised low-conductivity sensors, while hyper-saline environments could exceed the standard calibration range.

The method's reliance on emperical correlations derived from typical seawater compositions can introduce errors in waters ocean waters affected by external factors such as pollution or freshwater inflow from connecting rivers, which can alter ionic composition and introduce variability not captured by standard seawater-based calibrations.
In such environments supplementry practices may be necessary for accurate salinity measurements.
