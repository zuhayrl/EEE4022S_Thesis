\chapter{Testing and Evaluation}

To properly evaluate the system, multiple testing procedures were implemented.
These started with first testing the accuarcy of individual components on the \gls{pcb}, and then testing the probes ability to measure salinity, through voltage measurements relating to conductivity.
Additionally, tests were done on the \gls{ml} model programmed to map the salinity.

\section{Component and Equipment Testing}
Before the probe could be used to measure salinity, the accuarcy of its components needed to be tested.
These procedures were completed before the probe was encased in resin, as access to the circuitry was required.
